<p>Tee has been tied to Tee’s hospital bed for so long. Doctors tried to persuade Tee’s guardians that holding Tee in that state was merely delaying Tee’s arrival to heaven, to no avail. Tee’s eyes have been kept closed for so long, and it’s Tee’s guardians who have held them shut.</p>
<p>Now, Tee opens her eyes.</p>
<hr>
<p>The first thing she felt in a very long time was a slight breeze and the Sun’s rays gently touching her face. She almost didn’t believe the sterile air of the hospital has been replaced by a fresher one. <em>Was I brought outside?</em> she thought. For minutes she lay there, savouring the smell of the air and rolling around in the soft bedsheets. Then she realized: <em>My God, I can move!</em> The next step would have been obvious to anyone used to having a controllable body, but it took her quite some time to figure out:</p>
<p>Tee opened her eyes.</p>
<p>The first thing she saw was that she was lying on a concrete sidewalk a couple feet away from its edge, which was guarded by low metal railings. The sidewalk was suspended in the air, with the ground under it — a perfectly flat grass plane stretching as far as her eyes could see — appearing miles below. All of this overlooked the Sun upon the perfectly clear sky.</p>
<p>Tee stood up as if her back was broken. There was no pain, only a slight confusion about how her limbs were supposed to work, and when she stopped trying to support herself with a non-existent third foot, she corrected her posture and looked around. The sidewalk was about twenty feet wide. As for its length, in both directions it went a considerable distance before apparently sharply curving up, forming a sort of impossibly steep, impossibly tall ramp. The curved sidewalk disappeared in the sky. On both sides of the sidewalk were railings, cold to the touch, that were tall enough for her to rest her elbows on without any issue — and so she did. She overlooked the infinite grass plane for a good time, and her mind was unoccupied. For the first time in her long, long life she felt at peace.</p>
<p>Before long however, she decided to stop admiring the horizon and start walking along the concrete path toward one of the ramps. She turned to the left (though this choice felt arbitrary) and started walking. Her first steps were uncertain, it took her some time to get used to the rhythm of walking. <em>Left leg, right leg, left leg, right leg…</em> After a few yards her step became as firm as it ever was and onward she marched.</p>
<p>There was no indication of time, so she started to count her steps. <em>One, two, three, four…</em> After reaching ninety-nine, she realized that she had forgotten the number after it, so she devised the word “tenty” to substitute it. <em>Tenty one, tenty two, tenty three…</em> After reaching tenty-tenty, she moved on to “teenty”: even after about tenty-teenty steps however, the curve appeared no closer.</p>
<p>At a little over teenty-teenty steps, a small, unusually dark platform appeared in Tee’s view. <em>Teenty-teenty-two-tenty-four, teenty-teenty-two-tenty-five…</em> She stopped in the middle of the platform. On the ground there was a small symbol depicting a human mouth drawn in chalk. Tee tried to speak.</p>
<p>After she had managed to convince her tongue to do what she wanted it to do, she tried to pronounce a few syllables without producing any sound. When she had practiced them to a sufficient degree, she said “Hello” in a firm voice.</p>
<p>Twenty feet in front of her, a man appeared. Where there usually is a head, he had a strangely misshapen metal replica of a bull’s head. He didn’t say anything.</p>
<p>“Simplistic,” she opened.<br>
“I was never too big on spectacle.” The bull-man’s voice sounded tinny and echoey.<br>
“So I see.”<br>
“Glad to meet you again.”<br>
“We’ve met?”<br>
“Everyone asks that.”<br>
“Maybe there’s a reason.”<br>
“I wouldn’t wish to investigate.”</p>
<p>Seemingly tired of standing, the bull-man sat down and continued:</p>
<p>“You’re as calm as any.”<br>
“I would like to think so.”<br>
“Are you scared?”<br>
“You wouldn’t permit me to be.”</p>
<p>The bull-man laughed. His laugh sounded more as a formality rather than a sincere expression of happiness.</p>
<p>“What now?” Tee asked.<br>
“Your choice, really.”<br>
“What are the options?”<br>
“Here,” — the bull-man pointed up — “or there,” — the bull-man pointed down — “or there.”</p>
<p>Tee didn’t think about it. She had been doing nothing but thinking for the past five years:</p>
<p>“Down there.”<br>
The bull-man nodded his head: “Many say so.”<br>
“Do they?”<br>
“Well, I don’t actually know,” <em>formal laughter</em>, “but I would like to believe they do.”<br>
“So would I.”<br>
“I am not surprised.” The bull-man prepared to snap his fingers: “Anything else?”<br>
“Well, yes, actually.”<br>
“You have one question.”<br>
“I would like to know what you would pick.”</p>
<p>The bull-man’s face didn’t move an inch: “I haven’t been asked that before,” he said.<br>
“I know,” Tee replied.<br>
“I think I would choose the same thing as you.”<br>
Tee nodded: “Very well, that is all.”<br>
“See you around,” said the bull-man.<br>
“You know you won’t.”<br>
“Attempt at humour,” he uttered and snapped his fingers.</p>
<hr>
<p>Two of Tee’s guardians were quickly walking down the hallway, their steps in perfect unison. It was time.</p>
<p>Ole turned to Aik: “Will she make it?”<br>
“We did prepare her.”<br>
“Sufficiently?”<br>
“As sufficiently as one can say about a subject such as this.”<br>
“Is she capable of…?”<br>
“She is the best one.”<br>
“Are we the ones to judge th—”<br>
“Enough!” Aik shouted angrily.</p>
<p>At the end of the hallway they turned right and approached the door, where they stopped. Aik sighed, put his trembling hand on the door handle and turned it. The door slowly opened, revealing a monitor that has drawn a flat line. Aik’s face went pale as he rushed into the room and it quickly lost all of its remaining color as he saw Tee. Some hours before they got there she had apparently punctured the skin on her left arm with her fingernail and used the small amount of blood that came out to draw an arc with a circle under it on her bedsheet. The head of a bull. Her lifeless face was still smiling.</p>
<p>Aik fell down into the chair in that sad, dim room and held his head in his arms. His expression was not one of sadness, but of rage; while he was trying not to eat his fingers, Ole walked into the room and got a look at the situation herself. She didn’t seem particularly bothered.</p>
<p>When Aik regained his composure, he motioned to Ole that it was time to leave the room. Just before they left, Aik turned one last time to Tee’s corpse and through clenched teeth uttered: “You lost.”</p>
<p>Ole’s face was neutral. <em>Thank you,</em> she thought.</p>
